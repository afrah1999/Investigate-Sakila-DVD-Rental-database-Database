# Investigate-Sakila-DVD-Rental-database-Database
###In Programming for data science Nanodegree, I did a project where I explored a database related to movie rentals with 15 tables and
86 attributes by writing SQL queries to answer interesting questions about the database and gain an understanding
Of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
I then built visualizations to showcase the output of the queries using Power BI.
